#          This is probably one of the greatest apps ever created, if you don't agree you're probably wrong.
#          I started this project as a way if learning <mark>React</mark> and it has since grown into a fully fledged app. I have learned many skills through this and been I'm very proud of having this in my portfolio. If you don't have a project as awesome as this I would advise you make one.

            I have worked as a TA for [Probabilistic Artificial Intelligence](https://las.inf.ethz.ch/teaching/pai-f21), a class by Andreas Krause at ETHz. I held some tutorials and worked behind the scenes to prepare homework and slides.

        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          At Polimi I got in touch with the beautiful world of mathematics. I learned a lot of theorems from all over mathematics, but, even more important, I learned how to come up with extensive and original proofs. I also learned how to apply all of this knowledge in practical problems: from applied statistics to PDE's numerical calculus.

          In this master, I dived into the world of machine learning. Starting from theory, all the way to real-world implementations.

        title: Strong inductive biases provably prevent harmless interpolation
        caption: Published at ICLR 2023
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          Counterintutivly, many very large models perform well even when they interpolate the training data. However, there are still many exceptions in which this phenomenon fails. We investigates how inductive bias plays a crucial role. Paper available [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07605).

        title: Deep learning for satellite image forecasting of vegetation greenness
        caption: In review at Environmental Data Science, Cambridge 
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          We worked on a deep learning model to forecast how satellite images in a fixed location evolve through time, conditioned on weather data. We implemented a convolutional version of s LSTM network to encode prior knowladge of both temporal and spatial dependencies. The preprint is can be found [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.16.504173), code is available in [this repo](github.com/rudolfwilliam/satellite_image_forecasting).

      Alongside my interests in mathematics and machine learning, some of my other interests and hobbies are:
      - Rock climbing
      - Cooking ([Here](https://mmilanta.github.io/le_ricette_di_nonna_aua/) a website with my Grandma's recipes, but they are all in Italian)
